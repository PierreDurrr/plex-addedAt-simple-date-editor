# plex-addedAt-simple-date-editor

Ever needed to remove something from the "recently added" section of plex? Now you can.

You can even "pin" or "promote" things.

To use it, only feed it with your server url/IP, your username and password.
Then add the label to your items in plex and call the script.

Defaults are +48 hours in the future, and 30 days ago. Can be changed as what you want, same for label name.

Processed items will get the label removed automatically.

Script can be triggered manually or set up on a cron.
